# Hi, I'm Kehan Zhou 👋

I build software where geometry, precision, and structure actually matter.

Mostly working with C# / .NET, focusing on editor-style tools, graphics, and systems designed to evolve over time.

---

## What I care about

- Geometry-heavy editors and CAD-like tools
- Clear interaction models and predictable behavior
- Separating domain logic from presentation
- Codebases that remain understandable after years

---

## Currently

- Exploring 2D editors and geometry infrastructure
- Refining architecture for long-term extensibility
- Contributing to open source when it aligns with tooling quality

---

## Philosophy

Correctness > cleverness  
Clarity > abstraction  
Long-term maintainability > short-term speed
